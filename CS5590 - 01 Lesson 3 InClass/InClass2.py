# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example,a=[5,10,15,20,25])
# and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.
# For practice, write this code inside a function.
#


a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
print(a[0],a[-1])

#def list():
#    n = 0
#    a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
#    numlist = []

#    for i in range(0, 2):
#        numlist.append(a[n])
#        n = n - 1

#    print(numlist)

#list()
