# Baby-name-generator
This is a python code for generating baby names (boys and girls) using Hidden Markove Model (HMM).
There are two text files "namesBoys.txt and namesGirls.txt that contain names for boys and girls. The program uses these two files to find patterns and generate new names based on the lenght of the name that the user enters.
